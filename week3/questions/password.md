# Question 11 - Password Validation

Write the relevant codes to perform password validation with the following password rules:

- $password and $confirmPassword must be the same
- must not start and end with the same character (e.g. “abcdefga”)
- must not contain the same character more than 3 times (e.g. “abcdefgggg ”)

You should display the relevant error message(s) if the password violates the rules or display a message “The password is valid.” if it meets all the rules.

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<?php
    $password = "abcdefgh";
    $confirmPassword = "abcdefgh";

    // write your codes here, change the value of the $password and $confirmPassword fields to test for the rules accordingly.
?>

</body>
</html>
```
